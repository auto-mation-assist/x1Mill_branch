Current work with many changes in handling of jogging and spindle control
and inch to metric handling. I have been working on the homing and need further work
on not homing Z when not required. This may have problem right now.

Being bothered by 'you cant do that" issues when trying to run program. Likely a
Gstat related issue betwen QTvcp and my own concepts of system control. 

Will continue on this project as time becomes available.

Old files were relocated to folder 'old files' 

Current development work is using Mint 19.1. Machine interface is with
Mesa 7i80 with custom bit file.
