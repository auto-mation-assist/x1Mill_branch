This is a simulation of the x1_probing panel.
It is designed to use code within its
handler for button function defines and the
modified verser code to make it compatible
with the x1 probing gui. 

The button Icons have new names as do the
macros that gui requires.
 
The icon folder and the macro folder should
be kept as part of this gui and not seperated from it.

The primary buttons numbers for icon placement
are as below in case the links are lost.

Icons have names like:
outside_1.png
inside_3.png
down.png

The name and numbers agree with the positions below.
